# Peer Review

1. Yes
2. Yes, It measures the “curviness” of the ridges present on the skin cells of fish 
3. It’s kind of confusing if you don’t have any prior knowledge of what they’re talking about but it sounds like it concatenates the csv files then uses R to plot the points and use that info to calculate the curvature of the ridge. 
4. Yes they’re in the workflow. No, they aren’t Hoffman specific.
5. Yes it’s straight forward, maybe just specify if you make your own “Files_to_analyze" folder or you download it, etc. 
6. Yes they said it during the workflow section.
7. Yes, they are.
8. Yes. 
9. This is not necessary according to Emily’s email.
10. Yes.
11. Yes, the instructions were clear.
12. Yes, I got the same result. 
13. Maybe summarize the workflow section in a short simple paragraph so it’s easier to follow. As said in a previous point just specify where the “Files_to_analyze" folder comes from. Overall I found this project to be really well-thought out and thorough and I’m struggling to see anything that needs amending.
